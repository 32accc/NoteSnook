We are constantly working on Notesnook to make it the best private note taking app.

# `Q2 2021`
We are really exciting about what is coming to Notesnook by the end of Q2 2021.
- [x] **Desktop apps** for macOS, Windows & Linux.
- [ ] **Importing Notes** from files such as markdown, html, txt, docx and other note apps such as Evernote & Google Keep.
- [ ] **Two-Factor-Authentication** via Auth app & SMS.
- [ ] **Stylus & Drawing Support** to take notes by drawing on the screen. We will be adding a dedicated editor where you can draw and take notes.
- [ ] **Note Publishing** on a public url that is viewable by anyone with a shareable link. The note can be encrypted if required before publishing so only people with the password can view it.
- [ ] **Links:** A dedicated links screen where user can list all links and import browser bookmarks
- [ ] **Widgets on Android & iOS** - Initially we are working on adding a Quick Note widget to add notes without opening app.
