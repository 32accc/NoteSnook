Sharing a note with someone can be such a tedious task. You have to copy/download/export it to a file and upload it to some cloud storage and then attach it in an email and send it to them. 

With Notesnook, you don't need to do that anymore. Monographs enable you to share notes with anyone in just one click. Once a note is published as a monograph, you get a public url. 

You can share this url with anyone to view the contents of the note without downloading Notesnook. And the cool part is, you can encrypt monographs with a password!
