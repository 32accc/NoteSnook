# Welcome to Notesnook

!!!info Work in Progress
We are currently working on writing detailed docs for our app. The current version of docs is incomplete. If you would like to help us improve the docs, you can fork the repo on [github](https://github.com/streetwriters/notesnook) and send a pull request.

Notesnook is a simple and cross-platform **private notes app** that keeps all your notes organized and synced between your phone, tablet and computer.

We use best-in-class encryption algorithms **XChaCha20-Poly1305 & Argon2** that are stronger & safer than AES256, impenetrable & future-proof. Your notes are always encrypted on your device and then stored on servers. All your notes are 100% private. **No one but only you can read your notes (not even us).**

Take notes, capture ideas, create to-do lists, keep a journal, write your assignments and manage projects, we have got you covered everywhere.
