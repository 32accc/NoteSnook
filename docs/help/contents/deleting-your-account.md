## FAQs

### What information is deleted?

All your notes, notebooks, attachments, and any other data that you created within the app will be immediately deleted.

### Is there any way to recover deleted data?

No. Once you delete your account, it's gone for good and there is no way for us or anyone else to recover it. If your data is important to you, make sure to take a [backup](/backup-and-restore-notes-in-notesnook) before deleting your account or [exporting your notes](/export-notes-from-notesnook).
