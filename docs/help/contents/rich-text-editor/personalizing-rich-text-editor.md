## Default note title format in rich text editor

When you create a note in the text editor, a default title `Note $date$ $time$` is automatically set. You can change the default title format to better fit your needs.

Go to `Settings` > `Editor` > `Title format` to customize the title formatting.

### Supported formatting templates

**$date$**: Today's date

**$time$**: The current time

**$headline$**: Upto first 10 words of of a note headline

**$count$**: Current note count + 1

You can use a combination of these templates in the note title. For example `$headline$ - $date$` will become `Your note headline - 06-22-2023`.

## Line spacing

By default when you press enter on a line in the text editor, a new paragraph is created and the spacing is double. You can go to `Settings` > `Customization` > `Editor` to turn of `Double spaced lines` so when you press enter, the space between the lines is normal.
