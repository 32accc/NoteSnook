# Backup your notes

It is always a good practice to take a backup of your data so in case you lose access to your account, you don't lose your notes. Currently backups are local only.

> warning
>
> Since all your data is end-to-end encrypted, we do not have the access to restore your account if you forgot your account password and recovery key. Therefore we recommend that you store your password safely and make sure that you have saved your account recovery.

# [Desktop/Web](#/tab/web)

1. Go to Settings from Sidebar
2. Scroll down to `Backup & Restore` section
3. Click on `Backup Data` to download the `.nnbackup` file

# [Mobile](#/tab/mobile)

1. Go to Settings from Sidebar
2. Scroll down to `Backup and Restore`
