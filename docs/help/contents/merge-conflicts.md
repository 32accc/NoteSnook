# Merge Conflicts

## Why Merge Conflicts occur?
Merge conflicts occur when there are conflicting note edits on different devices for the same note. 

## How Merge Conflicts occur?
Lets suppose that you have two devices running Notesnook:

1. A desktop
2. And a mobile.

Suppose that one of your devices is offline. Now if you made edits to one of your (same)notes on both your devices and **synched changes** a merge conflict will occur.

## Where do Merge conflicts shows
The conflicted notes appear at the very top of the notes list. Just navigate to the Notes page and you will see them right away (If there are any).

## How to Resolve Merge Conflicts

# [Desktop/Web](#/tab/web)
Here are the steps to resolve this:

1. Finding the conflicted note. It appears at the top.
2. Opening it (you'll be taken to a conflict resolution screen)
3. If you are on a phone, 2 versions will appear above and below. If you are on the Web version, they will be side by side.

5. Go through both versions and choose which one you want to keep.
6. Press the Keep button on the note you want to keep.
7. And Discard button on the note you don't want to keep (you can also press the Save a Copy button).
