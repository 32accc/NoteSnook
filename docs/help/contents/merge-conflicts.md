# Merge Conflicts

## Why Merge Conflicts occur?
Merge conflicts occur when there are conflicting note edits on different devices for the same note. 

## How Merge Conflicts occur?
Lets suppose that you have two devices running Notesnook:

1. A desktop
2. And a mobile.

Suppose that one of your devices is offline. Now if you made edits to one of your (same)notes on both your devices and **synched changes** a merge conflict will occur.

## Where do Merge conflicts show
The conflicted notes appear at the very top of the notes list. Just navigate to the Notes page and you will see them right away (If there are any).

## How to Resolve Merge Conflicts
