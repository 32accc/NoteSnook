### Use recovery key

This is the safest method of recovering your account because it just decrypts your data using your old key & then re-encrypts it using the new password.

And that's it. You have now successfully recovered your account. Feel free to relogin on all your devices so you can sync & access your notes.

## Troubleshooting

### I am getting "ciphertext cannot be decrypted using this key" error during sync

This usually happens when some of your data is still encrypted with your older key. It is very rare, however.

The only way to recover from this corruption is to reset your account.

### I am getting "Sync server is not responding. Please check your internet connection..." error

The main cause of this error is our server getting timed out when clearing your data. If you have _a lot_ of data (in GBs) then you might face this.

As a work around, try again from a laptop using Google Chrome or Mozilla Firefox. However, there's a very low chance that it'll work. Unfortunately, there's no easy way around this. We are working on mitigating this ASAP.
