# Troubleshooting web clipper

## What to do if the web clipper doesn't connect?

There are a few things you can do try:

1. Make sure you are logged in on the Notesnook web app
2. Make sure you have the Notesnook web app opened in the background
3. The web clipper doesn't yet support multiple browser windows so make sure there aren't any additional browser windows opened in the background.
4. Try restarting the browser

## "Could not establish connection. Receiving end does not exist."

[Notesnook Web Clipper](https://notesnook.com/notesnook-web-clipper) shows this error when it cannot clip a web page for various reasons. Usually you'll see this error on browser default pages like the new tab page, extensions page etc.

However, if you are seeing this on a website it is recommended that you trigger a page reload. This will reinitialize the web clipper & hopefully proceed.

## What to do if a website appears broken in the web clip?

Since the [Notesnook Web Clipper](https://notesnook.com/notesnook-web-clipper) is still in alpha-beta stage, some rendering issues are expected in the web clips. If you notice any such problem, feel free to open a new issue on our [GitHub Issue Tracker](https://github.com/streetwriters/notesnook/issues/new/choose).
