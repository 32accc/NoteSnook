# Jumplist & dock menu

Notesnook supports quick actions from the "jumplist" menu (dock menu on macOS):

## [Windows](#/tab/windows)

## [Linux](#/tab/linux)

## [macOS](#/tab/macos)

## How it works?

The jumplist menu doesn't work if you already have Notesnook opened. They are responsible for opening Notesnook at the specified page. For example:

1. Close Notesnook if you already have it opened
2. Right click on the Notesnook icon in your taskbar/dock
3. Click on "New notebook"
4. Notice how the new notebook dialog is already opened after the app starts.
