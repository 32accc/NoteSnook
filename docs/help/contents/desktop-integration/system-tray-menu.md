## Minimize to tray

Instead of always taking space in your taskbar, you can hide Notesnook in your system tray on minimizing:

1. Go to `Settings`
2. Click on `Desktop integration`
3. Click on `Minimize to system tray` to enable/disable it.

## Close to tray

To prevent accidentally closing the Notesnook app, it is possible to always close it to the system tray:

1. Go to `Settings`
2. Click on `Desktop integration`
3. Click on `Close to system tray` to enable/disable it.
